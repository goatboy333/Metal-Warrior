Metal Warrior is a side scroller adventure game in which you start of as a villager and then your aim is to become a metal god!

Current bugs to fix :
---------------------

- attempt to recalculate sprite sheet source_* to lessen the sprite size
- Fix jump and attack
- Fix constant attack problem (possible use the tick time for difference). the countdown method resets with every press. ie attacks dont register if yr next to a creature and hit attack fast.

- Check duplication of keyboard.space X
- Getting output.solids to be brought to foreground when backgrounds are added.  X
- Change attack to single strike  X
